continue from week 8 i've added a sprites for each pokemons and it's type
by displaying the image i've to fetch another api which each pokemon has it's own
this causes old way to not be working properly because it's foreach async which is not good 
it will result in unordered of pokemon because it's take differnt times for each pokemon image to load
so i used promise.all to map each data of a pokemon out
